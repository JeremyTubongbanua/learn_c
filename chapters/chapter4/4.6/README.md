# 4.6 Static Variables

- `static` declaration, applied to an external variable or function, limits the scope of that object to the rest of the source file being compiled.
- external `static` declaration is most often used for variables, but it can be applied to functions as well.
- `static` for internal automatic variables remain in existence rather than coming and going each time the function is activated.
